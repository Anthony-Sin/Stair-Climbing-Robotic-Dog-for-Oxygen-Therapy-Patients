# Agent Operating Rules

## 1. Purpose of This File
This file contains only:
- Non-obvious project constraints
- Known failure patterns
- Recurring confusion points
- Lessons learned from prior agent mistakes

Do NOT treat this as general documentation. If something is obvious from reading the codebase, it should NOT be here.

---

## 2. Core Operating Principles
1. Do not assume conventions.
2. Do not refactor architecture unless explicitly instructed.
3. Prefer minimal, surgical changes.
4. Verify before destructive actions (overwrite, delete, replace).
5. When uncertain, ask instead of guessing.
6. Do not create fallbacks/safefails if not requested by the user; try to fix the core issue.

---

## 3. The "Surprise Rule" (Mandatory)
If you encounter:
- Behavior that contradicts common conventions
- Hidden coupling or side effects
- An unexpected failure after a seemingly correct change
- Any ambiguity that required developer clarification

You must:
1. Explicitly notify the developer.
2. Propose a concise addition to the Incident Ledger below.

---

## 4. Incident Ledger (Cross-Session Memory)
Each entry must follow this structure:
- **TRIGGER:** Condition or pattern that activates this rule.
- **LESSON:** What must or must not be done.
- **WHY:** Short explanation of failure mode.

---

## 5. Progressive Disclosure
If working in a specific domain or subdirectory:
- Check for a local `AGENTS.md` in that directory.
- Local rules override global ones.
- Do not load unrelated domain rules.

---

## 6. What Does NOT Belong Here
Do NOT include directory trees, tech stack summaries, style guides, obvious best practices, or long explanations. Keep this file short (<600 lines, ideally <500).

---

## 7. Special Rules
- This repository targets a **live remote robot system running on NVIDIA Jetson Orin** (currently working in the sim version).
- Operational commands for model export/conversion/inference must be run on the **robot**, inside the robot's **Docker container** used for runtime, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
- **Path mapping rule:**
  - The **repo root** is mounted as container working root `/workspace` (`docker/start_follow_system.sh`: `-v "$REPO_ROOT:/workspace" -w /workspace`). There is **no `src/`** dir; a container path is `/workspace/<repo-relative path>`.
  - When giving runnable commands for runtime tasks, prefer container-relative paths from `/workspace` (e.g., `python3 real/models/export_stairs_trt.py ...`), or explicitly state both host and container forms.
- Review the Jetson environment configuration located in the `/docker` directory to understand the system architecture, dependencies, and runtime environment.

## 9. Testing & Verification

**1. The Test Command & Execution**
- Tests must be executed on the **local computer** via CMD/Command Prompt or PowerShell.
- When you have completed a major task, made significant changes, or need to verify your results, **you must run the following sequence** to execute the simulation:

```powershell
  cd C:\Users\antho\Downloads\Stair-Climbing-Robotic-Dog-for-Oxygen-Therapy-Patients\sim
  .\run_sim.bat
